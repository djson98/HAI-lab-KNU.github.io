abstract: |
  Significant investment of time and effort for language learning has prompted a growing interest in microlearning.
  While microlearning requires frequent participation in 3-to-10-minute learning sessions, the widespread adoption of smart speakers in homes presents a new opportunity to proactively provide microlearning in daily life.
  However, such proactive provision may distract users. This study explores users’ perceptions and the interruptibility of more-than-one-minute conversational microlearning via smart speakers.
  A three-week field study (n=28) revealed contextual factors influencing opportune moments and design implications for proactive microlearning services.
