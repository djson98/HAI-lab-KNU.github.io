# K-EmoPhone: A Mobile and Wearable Dataset with In-Situ Emotion, Stress, and Attention Labels

## Abstract

With the popularization of low-cost mobile and wearable sensors, several studies have used them to track and analyze mental well-being, productivity, and behavioral patterns. However, there is still a lack of open datasets collected in real-world contexts with affective and cognitive state labels such as emotion, stress, and attention; the lack of such datasets limits research advances in affective computing and human-computer interaction.

This study presents K-EmoPhone, a real-world multimodal dataset collected from 77 students over seven days. This dataset contains:

1. **Continuous probing of peripheral physiological signals and mobility data** measured by commercial off-the-shelf devices
2. **Context and interaction data** collected from individuals' smartphones
3. **5,582 self-reported affect states**, including emotions, stress, attention, and task disturbance, acquired by the experience sampling method

## Dataset Overview

- **Participants**: 77 students
- **Duration**: 7 days per participant
- **Affect Labels**: 5,582 self-reported states
- **Data Types**: Physiological signals, mobility data, smartphone interaction data
- **Collection Method**: Experience sampling method (ESM)

## Key Contributions

- First large-scale real-world dataset with in-situ emotion, stress, and attention labels
- Multimodal data collection from mobile and wearable devices
- Comprehensive affect state annotations through experience sampling
- Enables research advances in affective computing and human-computer interaction

## Impact

This dataset addresses the critical gap in open datasets for affective computing research, providing researchers with real-world multimodal data to advance understanding of human emotional and cognitive states in naturalistic settings.
